# ESP32-LCD-I2S
Espressif ESP32 I2S peripheral in parallel LCD mode driving a controller-less 240 x 160 monochrome lcd  with 4bit data, clock, hsync and vsync.

## Features
Uses ESP32 I2S peripheral in 8bit parallel LCD mode. The bus is actually 6bits wide, and encodes 4bits of monochrome pixels plus the hsync and vsync signals.  The LCD requires an additional frame toggle signal that toggles once each frame - this is generated by hardware (edge-triggered d latch, or lsb of a binary counter with the vsync as clock pulse input).

Double-buffered memory with one frame buffer being continuously read out by the i2s peripheral. The other buffer can be updated asynchronously by the application, and flipped at any time. This avoids artifacts in the displayed image.
